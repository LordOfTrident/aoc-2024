Big relief, an easy day. I guess they put this in as a break from the hard previous days. I got part
1 working quickly. Part 2 was confusing at first, i had no idea what kind of christmas tree they
could be talking about. I was overthinking. I didnt think that just searching for a vertical line
would do it, but after searching for a hint, apparently that is the way. So i just implemented that
and got it working.

This was the last day of using C3, and it was a fine experience. I dont think im gonna use it for a
project like i would Hare. It is still a very young language, has a few compiler bugs here and
there and the syntax isnt my favorite. But its a fine language.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```
