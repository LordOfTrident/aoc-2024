This day was easy. Day 7 was about permutations, and now day 8 was about combinations, which are
easier. I also had no problems doing this day in Hare, its a pretty fine and nice language. I still
think the syntax could use a little less noise (its noisier than Rust), but its otherwise a pretty
good "C replacer". I will use it for a few more days.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```
