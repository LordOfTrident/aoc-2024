This day was really fun and easy. Got part 1 working shortly, cleaned up the code and then finished
part 2 under 1 minute and got it right first try. At first i used an enum for directions for part 1
and stuff, but then i decided i dont need any of that and it just bloats the code size, so i
condensed stuff and just used offsets as the directions directly, which also made them easier to
invert for part 2. I was really tired today and had a hard time getting myself to stay awake and
focused, so im glad the day was easy. Im also getting really comfortable with Hare, but i guess this
was the last day of me using it for AOC. It was a very nice experience.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```
