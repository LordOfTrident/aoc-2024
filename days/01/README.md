Starting off AOC 2024 with my *still* favorite language, C. Somehow, over 50 years later it is still
special and has not been not replaced. I have tried many other languages but i keep going back to C
for certain projects. This day was very easy to do even in C. I say that because C is not ideal for
AOC. Text parsing is a big part of AOC because of the inputs, and in C string manipulation and
parsing is a pain. The input reading part takes up like half of the source code for each part of
this day. But it was easy for this day.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```
