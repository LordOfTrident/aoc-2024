Going right to Rust for day 2, since its one of the languages im the most interested in. Part 1 was
quite easy to do in Rust, but i fought the compiler more than a few times in part 2. I eventually
settled on a dumber solution because i could not figure it out in Rust. It is what it is. It will
definitely take a while to get used to rust and the compiler screaming at you all the time, but it
is definitely interesting and i want to learn more. Other than fighting the compiler, part 2 also
confused me because the example passed but my input did not. I eventually found out there were 2
cases where backtracking was necessary, and i had to rewrite my solution.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```
