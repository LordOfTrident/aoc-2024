I dont like V. Part 1 was pretty easy, but my code for it is really ugly. I dont want to blame V,
but i also kinda do. It feels like Go but bad. You have probably already heard stuff about it and
its owner. By the time i got to part 2, i was already a bit annoyed by V and became even more
annoyed when i realised im not gonna come up with a clever solution for part 2 and i will have to
bruteforce it. I encountered a couple of bugs, didnt bother looking at better ways to do the stuff i
did in V, piled bad code on top of bad code and put it all together with duct tape. The result is a
program that takes **876.92 seconds** (14 minutes) to calculate the result. It is pretty bad, but it
works. Im obviously not satisfied with this so i do plan on returning to this day and cleaning up
the code. I can imagine doing this day in Rust and getting way better reuslts, but i dont want to
change the language after already spending so much time on this. I will (maybe) get back to this at
some point to clean up, refactor and optimize the code.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```
