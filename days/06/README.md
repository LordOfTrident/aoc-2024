I dont like V. Part 1 was pretty easy, but my code for it is really ugly. I dont want to blame V,
but i also kinda do. It feels like Go but bad. You have probably already heard stuff about it and
its owner. And by the time i got to part 2, i was already a bit annoyed by V and even more when i
realised im not gonna come up with a clever solution for part 2 and i will have to bruteforce it. I
encountered a couple of bugs, didnt bother looking at better ways to do the stuff i did in V, and
piled bad code on top of bad code and held it all together with tape. The result is a program that
takes **876.92 seconds** (14 minutes) to calculate the result. It is pretty bad, but it works. Im
obviously not satisfied with this so i do plan on returning to this day and cleaning up the code. I
can imagine doing today in Rust and getting way better reuslts, but i dont want to change up the
language after already spending so much time of the day on this. I will (maybe) get back to this at
some point and clean up, refactor and optimize the code.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```
