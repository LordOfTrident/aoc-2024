Continuing the Rust streak. Todays problem was pretty easy, got both parts on first try. My issue
with problems like this is not their difficulty clearly, but instead that i feel like the code i
write to solve them is really repetitive and feels like it could be much shorter and more condensed.
There is probably some rust magic to make the code shorter, but i dont think the generic algorithm
can have much improvements, unless inlining some stuff is better than using loops for such short
3-letter word matches. At some point im gonna look into how other people approach these problems.

## Quickstart
To run part 1 or part 2, do:
```sh
$ make part1
$ make part2
```
